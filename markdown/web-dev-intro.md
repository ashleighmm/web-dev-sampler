# What Do Web Developers Do?

class: center, middle

.large[
   Let's demystify some jargon...
]

---

# Types of Developers

- **Front-end** web developers typically work on the parts of a website you can see in a browser
- **Back-end** web developers usually work on the part of the website that makes sure all of the right data gets sent to and from the server to the browser
- **Full-stack** web developers on both the browser and database sides of a website

# And Web Designers...

- **Web designers** (often called "User Experience Designers") make sure our websites not only look great, but also work in the way the user expects them too
- UX designers play a big role in helping us get to know our users better, and testing our websites so we can make sure they support users in accomplishing their goals

# Client-side / Server-side

- Client-side scripts run in the **browser**
- For the most part, JS is the only client-side script today
- Server-side scripts run on a **server**
- PHP, Ruby, and Python run on the server side
- But JS can run server-side as well today using Node.js...

---

# JavaScript vs. jQuery

- jQuery **is** JavaScript
- It's cross-browser friendly
- It's usually easier to learn at first
- You have to add the jQuery library to your website to use it

### A Definition

Responsive web design involves dynamically adjusting a website's layout and content to work on any screen size, resolution, orientation, or device context.

---

### RWD &ne; Layout

You need to deal with *visual design* and *interaction design* concerns at the same time.

### What is Version Control?

Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.

---

# What is Git?

- Traditional version control system are "centralized" where a single central copy of a project lives on server, and developers **commit** their changes to it
- But there are some downsides to this approach...

---

# What is Git?

- Git is a **distributed version control system (DVCS)**
- Developers **clone** copies of the **repository** locally with all of its previous history intact
- There can still be an "authoritative" repository that team members push to and pull from

---

# Git vs. GitHub

- Git is the **version control system**
- GitHub is a **web-based app** where you can create and account and then store and share your Git repositories
- This website is an example of a private GitHub repository
