# Types of Developers

- **Back-end** web developers usually work on the part of the website that makes sure all of the right data gets sent to and from the server to the browser
- **Front-end** web developers typically work on the parts of a website you can see in a browser
- **Full-stack** web developers work on both the browser and server/database sides of a website

# And Web Designers...

- **Web designer** is a bit an antiquated, catch-all term
- Today, you're more likely to have **user interface (UI) designer** craft the look and feel of a website
- There are also UX designers, information architects, interaction designers, and content strategists
- UX designers play a big role in helping us get to know our users better, and testing our websites so we can make sure they support users in accomplishing their goals

# Client-side / Server-side

- Client-side scripts run in the **browser**
- For the most part, JS is the only client-side script today
- Server-side scripts run on a **server**
- PHP, Ruby, and Python run on the server side
- But JS can run server-side as well today using Node.js...

### A Definition

Responsive web design involves dynamically adjusting a website's layout and content to work on any screen size, resolution, orientation, or device context.

---

### RWD &ne; Layout

You need to deal with *visual design* and *interaction design* concerns at the same time.

### What is Version Control?

A version control system records changes to files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.

---

# What is Git?

- Git is like Time Machine for your code
- Git is a **distributed version control system (DVCS)**
- Developers **clone** copies of the **repository** locally with all of its previous history intact

---

# Git vs. GitHub

- Git is the **version control system**
- GitHub is a **web-based app** where you can create and account and then store and share your Git repositories
- This website is an example of a private GitHub repository
